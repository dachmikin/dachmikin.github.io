Yippee! Welcome to my first test blog page :D

Although I've previously dabbled in HTML, CSS and the like, this is my first time registering my own domain and deploying a real site to the internet! I've set this up by registering a Cloudflare domain and using Cloudflare Pages to help host the website. I then used a simple astro template, forked it on Git and used that as the backbone of my website.

Although the website still looks pretty rough around the edges, I plan to upgrade to a better UI in the updates to come. See you then!
